# Cardboard
Cardboard is a general-purpose modding library to simplify mod development, inspired by [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla) and [HoneyLib](https://github.com/BzzzThe18th/HoneyLib).

Cardboard comes with a pretty cool featureset, including:
- **Modded Lobby Handling**: Cardboard has delegates for joining and leaving modded lobbies simular to [Newtilla](https://github.com/Loafiat/Newtilla).
- **Asset Loading**: Cardboard includes an asset loading class that will load resources for you.
- **Patching**: Cardboard can handle Harmony Patching to reduce the size of your assemblies.
- **Input Handling**: Cardboard can handle input from the controllers including pressing on the stick.

For the full list of features, [see the documentation](https://github.com/sirkingbinx/cardboard/wiki/Cardboard-Docs).
